This is the README of GitObserve, a project of group "dalek",
using the GitHub API. The data coming from the API are in JSON format.
These data  are used to get users (to add to a watched user list),
to get repository names and more information about each repository of the user.
Those information are organized and shown in RepositoryPanes in the interface.
The Interface was made with JavaFx. 
The whole project should run out of the box
since all necessary packages are imported into the project (and ship with the project itself).
